const myHeading=document.querySelector("h1");// here we are using querySelector to grab the reference of the h1 then storing it in a variable called myHeading.
//similar to what we do using css selectors.
//here we are selecting the element h1, when we want to something to a element we have to select it first.
myHeading.textContent="Hello World!";//here we are setting(changing already existing content) the content using textContent property.
